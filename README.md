# This repository is for the vision of ultimate.ai team

## Coding challenge

The scope is to render a list of intents that can be selected, to be intended as a step 1 on a multistep initialization wizard.

### Start

```yarn start```


### Consideration

I tried to deliver this content for a time boxed effort of about 2h.
My main focus was towards UI/UX of the assignment. I used styled-components as styling system.

### Next Steps

The next step will be 
 - including an API layer to access asyncronous data coming from the api.
 - initializing a theming feature to be consistent with the stylings.
 - taking care of responsivity and mobile views.
 - architecture and development of the multi step form, and using IntentSelectionList as first step to be rendered
 - setup testing for Components, and unit testing for functionalities
